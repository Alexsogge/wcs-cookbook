# Description:

- The notebook in this folder can be used to generate a tflite model for usage in the CookbookMotion app.
- Data should be named after the gesture, the number of samples and an id for the data file, i.e. 'swipe\_right\_0_20.mkv' for a file containing 20 swipe right gestures.
- Each gesture name must be present in the list in the beginning of the notebook.
- Adding new gestures requires changes in the CookbookMotion app too!
